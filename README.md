# Studious Console
A console version of an app I am working on outside of class. This app is a study-buddy type app that helps generate practice quiz questions based on Bloom's Taxonomy question stems. 

Problem Definition:
Every student has a finite amount of cognitive ability before they begin to fatigue and feel stress. It is hard enough to focus on your study materials - keeping track of HOW you study often gets forgotten. This causes students to spend more time and more energy on a lower-quality study session. 

Goal:
ConsoleStudious will demonstrate the ease with which study questions can be generated by a simple C# Console app.
This code will be reusable for all .NET applications. 


Notes from whiteboard wf2020:
Video content that addresses TECHCareers issues re: Git and professional workflows
Provide searchable transcripts, subtitles, git repos, notes, quizzes, grading rubriks, etc.
Progressively build Studious and Transcript app starting with C# Console -> HTML/CSS Screens -> React with Node API, React with .NET API, Wordpress (shoehorn this in somehow).

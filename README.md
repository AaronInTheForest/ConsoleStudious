# ConsoleStudious
A console version of an app I am working on outside of class. This app is a study-buddy type app that helps generate practice quiz questions based on Bloom's Taxonomy question stems. 

Problem Definition:
Every student has a finite amount of cognitive ability before they begin to fatigue and feel stress. It is hard enough to focus on your study materials - keeping track of HOW you study often gets forgotten. This causes students to spend more time and more energy on a lower-quality study session. 

Goal:
ConsoleStudious will demonstrate the ease with which study questions can be generated by a simple C# Console app.
This code will be reusable for all .NET applications.
